%\section{\textsc{Summary}}
%An experienced mathematician with over ten years experience in scientific computing, and a track record of producing practical solutions to tough, real-world problems.  I have managed technical teams, and understand the importance of
%I am a motivated and self-starting advanced PhD student at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Science. 
%In addition to the strong quantitative skills necessary for research in mathematical science, I have strong writing and communication skills.  My objective is to obtain a full-time position in quantitative financial analysis, starting in Summer 2008.  I would be particularly interested in working with weather derivatives or weather insurance contracts.
