\employer{\textbf{Persefoni}}
\title{Senior Director of Data Science}
\location{Milton, MA}
\dates{June 2021 -- August 2022}
\begin{position}
Persefoni is a global software company that enables organizations and financial institutions to create regulatory-grade carbon footprint inventories and climate disclosures.  I hired and led a team of three Data Scientists that embedded in engineering pods to deliver greenhouse gas emissions calculations on the Persefoni SaaS platform.  My mission was to ensure that these calculations were at once scientifically accurate, based on the best available data, and verifiably aligned to key governing standards such as the \href{https://ghgprotocol.org/}{Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol} and the \href{https://carbonaccountingfinancials.com/}{Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF)}. I developed processes and testing infrastructure to promote accuracy and transparency, and used my experience in analytical validation to identify and resolve calculation errors before releasing to production.  My team sourced, structured, and integrated scientific and financial databases needed to power the calculations. I also drove initial R\&D to develop intelligent algorithms that help customers automatically identify the GHG protocol calculations corresponding to their available data sources.
